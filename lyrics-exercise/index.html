            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>
                I wonder if I'm being real<br>
                Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?<br>
                I wonder, wouldn't it be nice<br>
                To live inside a world that isn't black and white?<br>
                I wonder what it's like to be my friends<br>
                Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them<br>
                I wonder, I wonder

                Right before I close my eyes<br>
                The only thing that's on my mind<br>
                Been dreamin' that you feel it too<br>
                I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah<br>

            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>
                I wonder why I'm so afraid<br>
                Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint<br>
                I wonder, when I cry into my hands<br>
                I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man<br>
                And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side<br>
                And tell me that the world will end up alright<br>
                I wonder, I wonder
