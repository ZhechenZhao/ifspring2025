                Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of
                people, culture or subculture. This includes oral traditions such as
                tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, and other oral traditions.<br><br>
                This also includes material culture, such as traditional building styles common
                to the group. Folklore also encompasses customary lore, taking actions for folk
                beliefs, including folk religion, and the forms and rituals of celebrations such
                as Christmas, weddings, folk dances, and initiation rites.<br><br>
                Individual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types:
                material, verbal or customary lore. For the most part self-explanatory, these
                categories include physical objects (material folklore), common sayings,
                expressions, stories and songs (verbal folklore), and beliefs and ways of doing
                things (customary folklore). There is also a fourth major subgenre defined
                for childrenâ€™s folklore and games (childlore), as the collection and interpretation
                of this fertile topic is particular to school yards and neighborhood streets.
